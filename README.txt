# Kramer-et-al-2022-homogenization_differentiation_tropical-forests

Here we aim to assess the current 'state of the art' of biotic homogenization and differentiation processes in tropical and subtropical plant communities globally, using a systematic literature review. We present an overview and general trends about both processes.
